# BERC — Notes on Systems, Markets & Technology

> Thinking in systems. Writing in public.  
> Software, finance, strategy, and the mechanics behind modern power.

## What is this?

**BERC** is a personal knowledge base and editorial blog focused on:

- 🧠 **Systems thinking** (technology, economics, organizations)
- 📈 **Markets & finance** (macro, volatility, incentives)
- 🧩 **Software architecture** (from MVPs to scalable systems)
- 🧪 **Experiments & ideas** (things I’m testing, breaking, rebuilding)

This is not a tutorial farm.  
It’s a place to **think clearly**, document reasoning, and ship ideas.

## Why this exists

Most content online optimizes for:
- clicks  
- trends  
- shallow explanations  

This blog optimizes for:
- **clarity**
- **first-principles thinking**
- **long-term signal over short-term noise**

If you’re looking for polished marketing talk, this isn’t it.  
If you care about *how things actually work*, welcome.

## How to read this blog

You can:
- Read casually → skim essays  
- Go deep → follow linked notes & references  
- Track thinking → posts evolve over time  

Some ideas are **unfinished by design**.

---

## Tech stack (for the curious)

- **Framework:** Next.js  
- **Deployment:** Vercel  
- **Content:** Markdown / MDX  
- **Philosophy:** minimal UI, maximal signal  

The UI stays quiet so the ideas can be loud.

## Who this is for

This blog is for people who:
- Think ahead of their environment
- Are tired of surface-level content
- Build, analyze, or invest
- Prefer uncomfortable truth over comforting noise

If that resonates, you’re in the right place.

## Contact / Presence

- Writing here is the main channel.
- If something is worth building together, it will be obvious.
